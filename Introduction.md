# Introduction
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to run applications as Containers. A Docker Container is a light-weight, standalone executable package that binds application, its dependencies and resources required to run that application on any Operating System. Unlike Virtual Machines, Docker Containers run directly on Docker Engine and do not require a guest operating system. As Docker separates application and its dependencies from Guest OS, Docker Containers operates fast, consumes less memory, and can be deployed easily. For example, installing and running a heavy RDBMS application without Docker may take several hours. However, by using Docker, you can install and run RDBMS containerized image within a few minutes. 

Docker Desktop is a GUI application that provides a 360-view of containerized applications and microservices running on Docker. This guide explains the process to install Docker Desktop and run a sample application using Docker.

## Purpose
Using this guide, you can install Docker Desktop on your Windows system and run a sample containerized application on Docker.

## Intented Audience
This guide is developed for anyone who needs to install and work on Docker Desktop for Windows.
